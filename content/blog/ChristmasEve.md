Today is Christmas Eve. This morning the whole family went to the farmers market. We got croissants and a couple of gifts. My brother and I ran around and acted silly. Then we went to the grocery store.

We are going to Hibachi for dinner with Gigi and Bobby at 4:00pm. I think I might get a bento box. We went to Hibachi last Christmas eve; it's a new family tradition. Last Christmas my brother ate most of my dad's filet mignon.
