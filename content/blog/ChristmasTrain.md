### Morning

>Getting ready to ride the Santa train!

Today I'm going to see Santa! I am going to give him my Chrismas list. My elf is named Gumdrop!

Our friends Kathryn and Will are coming with us! My brother Oli is excited to see Santa too.

We have been on this train many times. We saw Santa here last year! We also rode this train at Halloween time and got some big pumpkins!

### Afternoon

I saw Mrs. Claus and Stanta Claus; and Oli saw them too! I gave Santa my Christmas list and he put it in his satchel.

I saw Kathryn and Will; Karthyn and I made a bracelet! We went out to lunch at the Golden Star Diner. I ate eggs sunny side up. Olivier ate chocolate chip pancakes (so did Will). Oli got covered in chocolate. He just picked out every chocolate chip and left the rest of the pancakes.

I had a wonderful time!
